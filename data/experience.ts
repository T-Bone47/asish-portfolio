 * Spec §26 — kept strictly separate from /data/projects.ts. Order
 * matches spec §67 ("Independent Motorsport / eSports" listed first,
 * then IGNICT). Periods and focus bullets updated against the Phase 2
 * prompt's §19, which gives a more precise IGNICT start date
 * ("Aug 2026–Present" vs. the original spec's plain "2026 — PRESENT")
 * and slightly tighter action-verb phrasing for both roles' bullets —
 * same substance, more precise/faithful wording, nothing new claimed.
